The project requires node and angular/cli installed in the system with bin added to the path.

The node modules have been removed from all the projects, hence the projects will not run.

To run the projects 
1. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the project root directory.
2. run: node install

This will install all the node modules from the package.json file.
Then run the project from the same command prompt using: ng serve

Open the browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/ to view the project
Refer the Angular 13 document in the repository for the guide.
